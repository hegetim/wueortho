       |A WueOrtho pipeline can be assembled using its JSON representation.
       |The pipeline describes a selection and order of algorithms to produce an orthogonal graph drawing.
       |Each step may read and write intermediate results to a shared cache to persist results and to promote data to following steps.
       |
       |Intermediate results are grouped by type into so-called stages.
       |Currently, there are the following stages:
       |$stages
       |
       |In order to execute pipelines, we provide runtimes with different feature scopes.
       |Runtimes define which steps a pipeline can have and provide implementations for each step.
       |This text was compiled for the '$id' runtime. Different runtimes may diverge in naming and functionality.
       |A pipeline for this runtime may produce different results or may not even run with other runtimes.
       |
       |A pipeline definition is a json object `{ "steps": [<step object>] }`.
       |Each step is defined by a step object `{ "type": "<step type>" }` with potentially more keys to configure the step's behavior.
       |For example the angle heuristic used to distribute ports on vertex boxes may be defined as follows.
       |```
       |$exampleStep
       |```
       |Each step is identified by its `type` key. The PortsByAngle step additionally has a mandatory `mode` key.
       |The `tag` key is a special key for all Steps that defines an id that is attached to all stages written by this step.
       |Some steps have input tags (like `graph` above). These can be used to select stages from which this step obtains its inputs.
       |
       |The following steps are available with this runtime.
